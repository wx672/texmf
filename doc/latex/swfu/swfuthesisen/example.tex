\section{History}
\label{sec:history}

Founded in the 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and
Salazar Slytherin, Hogwarts was established in the Highlands of Scotland to educate young
wizards and witches as well as to keep students safe from muggle
persecution.\cite{harrypotter} Theory has it that Rowena Ravenclaw came up with the name
of Hogwarts after dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a lake. Since then,
Hogwarts educated most wizarding children in the United Kingdom and its surrounding areas,
keeping its location hidden from other wizarding schools and
muggles.\cite{nla.cat-vn992642,nla.cat-vn7290756} Fig.~\ref{fig:hogwarts} shows the main building of Hogwarts school.

\begin{advisorInfo} % 指导教师简介
  
  Prof. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore is a fictional character in
  J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. For most of the series, he is the headmaster of the
  wizarding school Hogwarts. As part of his backstory, it is revealed that he is the
  founder and leader of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation dedicated to fighting
  Lord Voldemort, the main antagonist of the series.

  Dumbledore was portrayed by Richard Harris in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and
  the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. After Harris'
  death, Michael Gambon portrayed Dumbledore for all of the remaining Harry Potter
  films. Jude Law portrayed Dumbledore as a young man in the prequel film Fantastic
  Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.

  Rowling stated she chose the name Dumbledore, which is a dialectal word for "bumblebee",
  because of Dumbledore's love of music: she imagined him walking around "humming to
  himself a lot".
